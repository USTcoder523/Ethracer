# Ethracer

This repository contains official Python3 implementation of smart contract analysis tool Ethracer. It can be used to find EO vulnerabilities in smart contracts. For more information about the bugs and the tool, you can read our technical paper [Exploiting the laws of order in smart contracts](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11605)

## Dependencies:

### Docker

Install docker from [here](https://runnable.com/docker/install-docker-on-linux)

### Ethereum blockchain

Ethracer requires a fully synced blockchain for maximum performance. Sync the blockchain over port 8666, more on this [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum). If you have a fully synced blockchain already then,

     geth --datadir [chainDirectory] --rpc --maxpeers 0 --rpcport 8666

**Important:** There should be a working network connection between docker and Ethereum blockchain server.

## Steps to run

Environment Variables:

- `ETHRACER_REPORTS`: the output dir of the reports (default: `report/`).
- `ETHEREUM_ENDPOINT`: the ethereum endpoint url of an archive node to connect to (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8666`).

### Build docker container from Ethracer directory

    sudo docker build -t ethracer .

### Run docker

    sudo docker run --net='host' -it ethracer bash

### Fire Ethracer!

    cd /ethracer/HB && python3.6 main.py --checkone [Contract source code] [Contract address] --blockchain --owner [Owner address]

### Run Tests

Make sure that you have a **Fully synced blockchain** (atleast uptil 5400000 block number) and that it is running on port 8666. Run the command below and check the /ethracer/HB/reports directory. You can find all the traces including the minimal ones with EO bugs, for two contracts given in tests folder.

    cd /ethracer && make runTests
